# dispatch-route-helpers.sh — Reference implementation of the dispatch
# routing helpers, kept in sync by hand with the inline copies in
# dispatch.yml (per-org) and reusable-dispatch.yml (per-repo).
#
# The workflows define these functions inline rather than sourcing this
# file, since sourcing would require an extra checkout step in every
# dispatch run. This file exists so the routing logic is unit-testable
# (ADR-0005) — see dispatch-route-helpers-test.sh.
#
# Required env vars (set by the caller before sourcing):
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY  — full repo name (org/repo)
#   ORG_NAME           — repository owner / org name
#   GH_TOKEN           — GitHub token for API calls
#
# Optional env vars (used by routing callers):
#   COMMENT_USER_LOGIN, COMMENT_BODY, COMMENT_USER_TYPE,
#   COMMENT_AUTHOR_ASSOC, ISSUE_LABELS, PR_LABELS,
#   ISSUE_USER_LOGIN, PR_USER_LOGIN, EVENT_SENDER_LOGIN,
#   REVIEW_USER_LOGIN, REVIEW_STATE, TRIGGERING_LABEL,
#   PR_HEAD_REPO, PR_BASE_REPO

#      every adopting org installs the SAME public fullsend-ai-<role>[bot]
#      Apps, regardless of the installing repo's own org name — this is
#      the default/normative deployment model, so these identities are
#      trusted unconditionally, independent of ORG_NAME.
#   2. A self-managed org's own exact ${ORG_NAME}-<role>[bot] identity, for
#      orgs that run their own private per-role Apps (ADR 0029/0033) named
#      after themselves. Exact role match only — not a suffix wildcard —
#      so a third party can't forge the bypass by registering an app named
